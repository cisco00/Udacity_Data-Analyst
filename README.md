## Summary of Findings
- The analysis shows the mode of transaction being used by importers of goods in 2019. Although bills for collection for payment mode seems to be more common than letters for credit, but after some further investigations that is true but letters for credit are mostly used for high cost of freight.
- The analysis also point to the fact that Zenith bank is the most predomiant bank used in import transaction for 2019 with over 12000 transactions for both letter of credit and bill of collection payment modes.

## Key Insights for Presentation
- Dollars is the predominant currency used for transaction in Nigeria for both Bill of Collection and Letters of Credit with over 70 percentage.
- Union bank has the highest transaction in cost of freight.
- From the exploration it was revealed that there is a strong positive relationship between cost of freight and fob val after using logarithmic scale for x and y axis, that is the higher the cost of freight the higher the fob value, however further analysis can be done to test the significance of the correlation.
- For presentation i focused on the frequency distribution of fob values and the relationship between free on board and freight values as well as cost of freight on payment mode across the banks.
